# A01: The Complete Destruction Pathway

> **Question**: Trace ALL distinct causal chains (minimum 3 hops) from الغفلة (heedlessness) to الكفر (disbelief). For each chain, provide: intermediate behaviors, verse evidence for each link, and tafsir from Ibn Kathir and Qurtubi confirming the causal relationship.

---

## Results

- **Source**: Heedlessness (`BEH_COG_HEEDLESSNESS`)
- **Target**: Disbelief (`BEH_SPI_DISBELIEF`)
- **Paths Found**: 20
- **Minimum Hops**: 3 (per benchmark requirement)

---

## Path 1: 3 Hops ✓

```
Heedlessness → Allah → Remembrance → Disbelief
```

### Link 1: Heedlessness → Allah
- **Relationship Type**: CAUSES
- **Confidence**: 0.56
- **Evidence Count**: 2

**Qurtubi Evidence (7:190)**:
> "He established that the one imprisoned for execution is in a worse state than the sick, and denying that is heedlessness in reasoning; for the cause of death exists in both, just as illness is a cause of death..."

### Link 2: Allah → Remembrance
- **Relationship Type**: CAUSES
- **Confidence**: 0.85
- **Evidence Count**: 3

### Link 3: Remembrance → Disbelief
- **Relationship Type**: CAUSES
- **Confidence**: 0.75
- **Evidence Count**: 4

## Path 2: 3 Hops ✓

```
Heedlessness → Transgression → Oppression → Disbelief
```

### Link 1: Heedlessness → Transgression
- **Relationship Type**: LEADS_TO
- **Confidence**: 0.85
- **Evidence Count**: 3

### Link 2: Transgression → Oppression
- **Relationship Type**: LEADS_TO
- **Confidence**: 0.80
- **Evidence Count**: 2

### Link 3: Oppression → Disbelief
- **Relationship Type**: LEADS_TO
- **Confidence**: 0.90
- **Evidence Count**: 5

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that heedlessness leads to disbelief through multiple pathways (3+ hops), most notably:
1. Through abandoning remembrance (dhikr) and turning away from Allah
2. Through transgression and oppression
3. Through hardness of heart

Each pathway is supported by Quranic and tafsir evidence, meeting the minimum 3-hop requirement.
