## Path 2: 2 Hops

```
Heedlessness → Transgression → Disbelief
```

### Link 1: Heedlessness → Transgression
- **Relationship Type**: LEADS_TO
- **Confidence**: 0.85
- **Evidence Count**: 3

### Link 2: Transgression → Disbelief

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that heedlessness leads to disbelief through multiple pathways, most notably:
1. Through transgression and oppression
2. Through hardness of heart
3. Through abandoning remembrance (dhikr)

Each pathway is supported by Quranic and tafsir evidence.
