## Required Capabilities

- `GRAPH_CAUSAL`: Graph causality analysis
- `MULTIHOP`: Multi-hop path tracing
- `TAFSIR_MULTI_SOURCE`: Multiple tafsir sources
- `PROVENANCE`: Source provenance

---

## Methodology

Cycle detection requires:
1. Behavioral graph analysis
2. Finding paths that return to the starting point
3. Verifying that each link reinforces the next

---

## Example Cycles

### Repentance and Faith Cycle
```
Repentance → Faith → Righteous Deeds → Repentance
```

### Heedlessness and Sin Cycle
```
Heedlessness → Sin → Hardness of Heart → Heedlessness
```

## Conclusion

Positive cycles represent self-reinforcing patterns in Quranic behavior. Understanding these cycles helps in:
- Identifying entry points for positive change
- Understanding how good behaviors reinforce each other
