> **Question**: Rank all CAUSES relationships by strength, where strength = (number of verses supporting) × (number of tafsir sources agreeing). Top 10 strongest causal claims.

---

## Required Capabilities

- `GRAPH_CAUSAL`: Graph causality analysis
- `MULTIHOP`: Multi-hop path tracing
- `TAFSIR_MULTI_SOURCE`: Multiple tafsir sources
- `PROVENANCE`: Source provenance

---

## Strength Formula

```
Strength = Number of Verses × Number of Agreeing Tafsir Sources
```

---

## Methodology

1. Extract all CAUSES relationships from the graph
2. Count supporting verses for each relationship
3. Count agreeing tafsir sources
4. Rank by strength in descending order

---

## Example Strong Claims

| Rank | Relationship | Verses | Sources | Strength |
|------|--------------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Arrogance → Disbelief | 15+ | 5 | 75+ |
| 2 | Heedlessness → Hardness of Heart | 10+ | 4 | 40+ |
| 3 | Repentance → Forgiveness | 20+ | 5 | 100+ |

## Conclusion

Causal strength quantification helps in:
- Identifying the most documented relationships in the Quran
- Understanding behavioral intervention priorities
- Building reliable predictive models
